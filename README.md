The project looks at the alcohol as a target when using adaboost regressor, light gradient boosting machine, and decision tree for regression. lgbm was used for the prediction and the result was 0.0618 for the MAE so it was rather accurate with the results since closer it is to 0 the more accurate it is. On unseen data the lgbm model has a 0.1931 MAE so that is worse then it knowing the results but that is still pretty good for the scale of the project.
